# Ultimate WiiU Virtual Console Injectors

Building them shall work flawlessly, but if you want to know, I used Visual Studio 2015 for it.

Tools used for the injectors (packaging and so on):
- 7zip (NDS)
- JNUStool
- NUSpacker
- png2tga
- N64Converter (jar, N64)
- RetroInject (NES/SNES)
- romutil (NES/SNES)
- wiiurpxtool (NES/SNES)
- inject_gba (python, GBA)



Injectors added to this that i do not own:
- KhaderWelaye's Wii/Gamecube VC injector (https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-wiivc-injector-script.483577/)
